<ul><dt><h2>History of palestine </h2>
    <br>
<dd><p>The history of Palestine begins between 7500 and 3100 BC, and this is confirmed to us by archaeological discoveries found south of Nazareth on Mount Al-Qahfra, and near Tiberias at the foot of the sand. Jericho was the oldest town throughout history. At the end of the fourth millennium BC, man in this region was able to identify copper, and used it in their tools, and this period in Palestine was called the Chalcolithic Age. The name Palestine came in relation to the tribes that invaded and settled in Jaffa and Gaza and merged with the Canaanites who inhabited it, and Palestine has gone through many migrations, the most important of which are:

<p>
In the eighties of the nineteenth century, Western Jews began to adopt new theories of colonization of Palestinian territories based on the idea of replacing attempts at civil or peaceful domination with armed domination. One of the greatest adopters of this theory was the world Zionist movement, which said, "The day we build one Jewish battalion is the day our state will be established."

In the mid-1880s, the Zionist movement in Europe formed the group "Lovers of Zion" (the first Zionist Congress was in Basel in 1897). This movement demanded the establishment of a state for Jews, and many Zionists argued that the location of this state should be in the place of the historic Jewish state, the area known as Palestine. Palestine was then part of the Ottoman Empire and enjoyed local government (wilayat), and the area was mainly inhabited by Palestinian Arabs (Jews constituted less than 8 percent until 1920). 

This Zionist project was met with popular anger throughout Palestine, and categorical rejection by all political figures at the time,and these were the beginnings of the emergence of popular resistance in Palestine. While the positions of Arab personalities and Arab rulers varied in their dealings with this project, some of them supported the Palestinians in achieving their destiny, some of them remained silent, and some of them extended their hand to the leaders of the Zionist movement in order to gain the approval of the British government.
As for the Western countries, they welcomed the Zionist project in Palestine, and the project received financial, military and logistical support from major countries such as Britain, the United States and France. It saw the Hebrew state that the Zionists aspire to establish in Palestine as a protection for its interests in the region.

<br>
<dt><h2>Jewish immigration:</h2>
<dd><p>According to official statistics, 367845 people (Jews and non-Jews) have immigrated to Palestine since the end of the nineteenth century, of whom 33304,1920 immigrated legally between 1945 and 50000. Between 60000 and Jews, and a small number of non-Jews, immigrated illegally during this period. Immigration led to most of the increase in the Jewish population, while non-Jews came greatly increasing the natural population. There is no firm data on immigration to Palestine from Arab countries.
Britain began to deal cautiously with the Arab and Jewish sides, but under the pretext of anti-Semitism in Europe, which grew during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the result was that Jewish immigration (mostly from Europe) to Palestine began to increase significantly, creating much Arab resentment. This led the British government to place restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine and issued the White Paper to stop and regulate Jewish immigration to Palestine. These quotas are controversial, particularly in the final years of British rule. A sentiment grew in many Arab countries to fight the British and some Jewish organizations that attacked the Arab population in response to attacks on Jewish groups. Jews relied militarily on the Haganah, a semi-secret militia that collaborated with British authorities during World War II and then fought the British and Arabs on the eve of the Mandate Revocation. During this period, more radical Jewish organizations such as the Irgun and the Stern Group (Lehi) were also active, which carried out terrorist operations and launched a violent campaign against Arab and British targets.

<br>
<dt><h2>The Great Palestinian Revolt:</h2>
<dd><p>It is one of the largest popular revolts carried out by the Palestinian people against British colonizers and Jews immigrating to Palestine at the time of the British Mandate of Palestine, such as the revolution of 1920, 1921 and the Buraq revolution in 1929. It lasted three continuous years, starting from 1936 to 1939, following the death of Sheikh Izz al-Din al-Qassam at the hands of the British police in Jenin. A general strike was then declared, which included most of the Palestinian Arab cities.<br>

<p>
During the British Mandate of Palestine and even after the establishment of the State of Palestine, the Zionist movement carried out a number of pre-planned things aimed at deporting Palestinians and ethnically cleansing Palestine, such as targeting Palestinian villages and cities with terrorist attacks by Haganah, Irgun and Stern.

These operations led to the Jewish takeover of approximately 78 percent of historic Palestine, and the killing and forced displacement of 750,to one million Palestinians to neighboring countries and other parts of Palestine. Palestinian refugees who emerged from the areas on which Israel was founded formed a new nucleus of the Palestinian cause.

Between 1947 and the 1948 war, some 750000,4 Palestinian Arabs were displaced from their towns.  After the end of the war, the Mandate area was divided between Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, where Israel granted Israeli citizenship only to those who remained within its borders and refused to return displaced Arabs from outside these borders. Jordan granted citizenship to residents of the West Bank, including refugees. Residents of the Gaza Strip and refugees remained without citizenship as Egypt refused to grant them Egyptian citizenship. Today, refugees constitute almost half of the Palestinian population, or about 6.1995 million .

<br>
<dt><h2>Establishment of the State of Israel:</h2>
<dd><p>After the end of World War II in 1945, the intensity of Zionist guerrilla attacks on British forces in Palestine escalated, prompting Britain to refer the Palestinian problem to the United Nations, and on April 28 the session of the United Nations General Assembly on the question of Palestine began, and the work of the sessions concluded on May 15, 1947 with the decision to form the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, a committee consisting of 11 members, this committee published its report on September 8. Most of its members supported the partition solution, while the remaining members recommended a federal solution, the Arab Higher Committee rejected the partition proposal, the Jewish Agency declared its acceptance of partition, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to partition respectively, and the British government announced on October 29 its intention to leave Palestine within six months if a solution acceptable to Arabs and Zionists was not reached.

In the period that followed, the pace of military operations escalated from all sides, and the Zionists had deliberate plans that they applied and controlled every area from which the British forces withdrew, while the Arabs were in a state of military crisis due to the delay in taking effective measures to build a regular Arab force to defend Palestine, and the Zionist forces succeeded in occupying areas more than what they obtained in the partition decision, and large numbers of Palestinians left their cities and villages because of the battles or because of fear of The massacres they heard.

On May 13, Chaim Weizmann sent a letter to US President Truman asking him to fulfill his promise to recognize a Jewish state, and announced the establishment of the State of Israel in Tel Aviv on May 14 at four in the afternoon, and the British High Commissioner left his official headquarters in Jerusalem heading to Britain, and in the first minutes of May 15, the British Mandate over Palestine ended and the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel became effective, and the United States recognized the State of Israel ten minutes later, But the fighting continued, but now this has become the war between the State of Israel and neighboring Arab states.

By the end of the war, Israel had become a reality, controlling areas beyond what was stipulated in the decision to partition Palestine, and occupied from Palestine (according to the division of the British Mandate) the entire coastal plain except for the Gaza Strip.

<p>
The Palestinian-Israeli War or Hamas-Israel War is an ongoing armed conflict that began on 7 October 2023 between Palestinian armed groups led by Hamas on the one hand and the Israeli army on the other.The conflict began with a coordinated and sudden qualitative attack by Hamas on Israel, which began on the morning of Saturday (October 7, 2023) (22 Rabi' al-Awwal 1445 AH) with the launch of at least 3000,38 rockets from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip towards Israel.  In parallel, about 39,1400 Palestinian militants broke through the barrier between Gaza and Israel and launched an attack via SUVs, motorcycles, gliders, etc. on towns adjacent to the Strip, known as the Gaza envelope, where they took control of a number of military positions, especially in Sderot, reached Ofakim, and stormed Netivot.They engaged in violent clashes in the three and other settlements, captured a number of soldiers and took them to Gaza, as well as seizing a range of Israeli military vehicles.The attack killed at least 260,41 Israelis people at the Ra'im music festival.  Israel began launching revenge attacks before officially declaring war on Hamas the next day. 

Israeli channels and Western media outlets have called the Hamas attack on the dance music festival "Super Nova Sokkot Gathering" outside the settlement of Ra'im a "massacre" as the deadliest attack in history.  Hamas's Operation Al-Aqsa Flood coincided with the end of the Jewish Throne Day holiday, which marks the 50th anniversary of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. 

The recent history of the conflict between Gaza and Israel dates back to 2006. However, Hamas has avoided any major clashes with Israel since 2022 and most of 2023, leading analysts to conclude that it was preparing for its major offensive called Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.Hamas also stated that it received support from Iran for the attack, which it says was in response to Israeli settler violence, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the desecration of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as Israeli atrocities against Palestinians over the past decades.

Israeli forces began their offensive by retaking settlements previously controlled by Hamas forces and carrying out airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, killing 2,750 Palestinians by the October 15 border. According to the United Nations, about one million Palestinians, nearly half of Gaza's population, have been internally displaced.  Fears of a humanitarian crisis grew after Israel cut off supplies of food, water, electricity, and fuel to Gaza, which was already besieged by both the governments of Egypt and Israel.Israel sent letters urging one million and one hundred thousand Gazans to evacuate northern Gaza, which amounted to forced displacement that would amount to a war crime. The United Nations and several countries have called for an immediate ceasefire.  Human rights groups have called for the absorption of Gaza refugees due to the war. 
</p>
<p>
According to the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health, health-care providers in Gaza are operating in "appalling conditions", and has documented that 24 hospitals in the Strip have been damaged by direct attack, 60 ambulances have been targeted and at least 12 health workers killed. 

On 24 October, the Palestinian Ministry of Health announced during a press conference held by the Palestinian Minister of Health, Mai Al-Kayla, that the health system in the Gaza Strip had completely collapsed
